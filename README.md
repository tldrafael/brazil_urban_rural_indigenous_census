## **Welcome**

This application is based on the [Brazilian Demographic Census of 2010](http://censo2010.ibge.gov.br/), and it intends to show how the urban, rural and indigenous population of the Brazil are spread along the national states, and how the population has been growing or diminishing compared to the last censuses.  

The app is avalaible [here](https://toledo-rafael.shinyapps.io/urban-rural-indigenous-census-BR/).  

The project also is intended as an evaluable assignment of the Coursera course [Developing Data Products](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products), which also contains a small presentation of the application in *slidify*, it can be seen [here](https://tldrafael.github.io/coursera-developing-data-products/slidify/index.html).  
  

The code for the shiny application are at [shiny_app](./shiny_app).  

To get and prepare the data to the shinyapp, you can check [here](./get-data), all codes are reproducible.

## **Welcome**

This application is based on the Brazilian Demographic Census of 2010. The data is available on the *Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat√≠stica*, [IBGE](http://censo2010.ibge.gov.br/) site.  

In the app you can get an overall perspective about how the population is spread over Brazilian territory on the demographic map chart. On the stack area chart you check the growth or diminishment of the population along the years. This behaviour is the same for `indigenous` and `urban-rural` session.

The sidebar contains all union states, you can select or unselect them to do an exclusive analysis or to combine the states freely. Don't forget to select them all if you want to see the Brazil absolute numbers.
